# KERNEL PANIC

A terminal-driven visual novel about trauma, codependency, and the slow unraveling of two medicated teens in love.

---

## What is this?

**Kernel Panic** is a hybrid visual novel + symbolic terminal simulator.

You play as **The Hacker**, a high school student on heavy ADHD meds, and navigate your relationship with **The Cowgirl**, a girl dealing with the emotional flatline of SSRIs, a fractured identity, and more grief than she knows what to do with.

It's not about saving the world. It's about trying to survive **each other.**

---

## Gameplay Breakdown

- Terminal Mode: Simulates introspection, symbolic memory decryption, and internal emotional commands.
- Visual Novel Mode: Dialogue-driven story choices, trust/guilt/dissociation-based routes.
- Micro-Exploration: Environmental interactions supporting slice-of-life and memory-triggered flashbacks.
- Emotional Stat System: Track Hope, Trust, Forgiveness, Guilt, Anger, Dissociation, and Self.
- Multiple Endings: Including a “System Shutdown” ending so emotionally nuclear it’ll leave scars.
